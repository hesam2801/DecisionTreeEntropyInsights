# Unlocking Decision-Making: An In-Depth Analysis of Entropy in Decision Trees

## Overview
This project explores the concept of entropy in decision trees, a fundamental element in machine learning that aids in making informed decisions based on data. The provided Python code calculates entropy values to identify optimal splits in classification tasks, enhancing decision-making processes.

## Features
- **Entropy Calculation**: Computes entropy based on input data.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes how different attributes impact decision-making.
- **NumPy Utilization**: Efficiently handles numerical operations for performance.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hesam2801/DecisionTreeEntropyInsights.git
cd DecisionTreeEntropyInsights
```
Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Code Example
Hereâ€™s a snippet of the code used to calculate entropy:
```python
import numpy as np
import math

def calc_entropy(data):
    # Implementation details...
    return entropy_value
```
### Entropy Formula
$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i)$
#### Where:
- $P(x_i)$
- *n* is the number of possible outcomes.
### The weighted average entropy for splits is calculated as:
- $H_{\text{split}} = \frac{N_1}{N} H_1 + \frac{N_2}{N} H_2$
#### Where:
- $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the sizes of the subsets.
- $N$ is the total number of samples.
- $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the entropies of the subsets.
